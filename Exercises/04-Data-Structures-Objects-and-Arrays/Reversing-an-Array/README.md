# Reversing an Array

## Task

---

Arrays have a `reverse` method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, `reverseArray` and `reverseArrayInPlace`. The first, `reverseArray`, takes an array as argument and produces a _new_ array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, `reverseArrayInPlace`, does what the `reverse` method does: it _modifies_ the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard `reverse` method.
